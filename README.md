# ðŸ“¦ Maine State Prison Industries - Announcements Board

This repository contains the announcement board system for the Maine State Prison Industries system. The overall project was designed to modernize the way payroll, employment, production, inventory, and shipping data is managed within the facility.  This particular program runs on next.js and acts as a local network server which can receive requests to broadcast a message.  This or another computer on the network will have a full screen browser window open that will display the broadcasted message via an attached array of monitors.
